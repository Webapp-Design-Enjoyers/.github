# Webapp Design Group

Hello! You've landed upon the Webapp Design Group! This is a public repository where anyone can do whatever they want!

## Developing

This organization is fully open, so if you want to add something, feel free! We would like to respect [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), following something along the lines of [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). That being said, this is a suggestion, and if you're working on a solo repository, commit to main at your own risk.
